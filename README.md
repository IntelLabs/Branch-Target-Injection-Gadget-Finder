## Overview
The intent and behavior of this tool are described in this
[blog post](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/news/update-to-research-on-disclosure-gadgets-in-linux.html).

## Build and Install
Refer to [existing directions](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) to
set up LLVM. Ensure that the `X86` target is included in the
`LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD` CMake variable, and ensure that `clang` and `lld` are
included in `LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`. Then within the top-level `llvm-project`
directory, run the following commands:
```
$ git checkout 5c68a1cb123161b54b72ce90e7975d95a8eaf2a4 # the llvmorg-15.0.4 tag
$ git apply <path-to-Branch-Target-Injection-Gadget-Finder>/bti-gadget-finder-llvmorg-13.0.0.patch
```
and then build (or rebuild) LLVM, and optionally install (or reinstall) LLVM.

## Scanning the Linux kernel
Within the Linux kernel top-level directory, run the following commands to
configure the kernel for a link-time optimization (LTO) build:
```
$ make LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 CC=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/clang defconfig
$ scripts/config -e LTO_CLANG_THIN
```
And then to build and scan:
```
$ make LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 CC=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/clang \
    HOSTCC=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/clang \
    LD=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/ld.lld \
    KBUILD_LDFLAGS="-mllvm -x86-bti-gadget-finder -mllvm -stats -mllvm -x86-bti-symbols"
```
This command will scan the kernel for linear disclosure gadgets, print summary
statistics, and emit symbols (prefixed with `__BTI__`) into the kernel binary 
to indicate components of a gadget. For example:
```
$ objdump -d vmlinux -M intel
...
ffffffff8149cfd0 <hctx_type_show>:
ffffffff8149cfd0:       0f b7 87 fc 00 00 00    movzx  eax,WORD PTR [rdi+0xfc]
ffffffff8149cfd7 <__BTI__Transmit_Call_17>:
ffffffff8149cfd7:       48 8b 14 c5 50 85 42    mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rax*8-0x7dbd7ab0]
ffffffff8149cfde:       82
ffffffff8149cfdf:       48 89 f7                mov    rdi,rsi
ffffffff8149cfe2:       48 c7 c6 58 b4 3c 82    mov    rsi,0xffffffff823cb458
ffffffff8149cfe9:       31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
ffffffff8149cfeb:       e8 10 9c de ff          call   ffffffff81286c00 <seq_printf>
ffffffff8149cff0:       31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
ffffffff8149cff2:       c3                      ret
...
```
The tool can also print graph representations of disclosure gadgets when the
`--x86-bti-dot` option is provided (`-mllvm -x86-bti-dot` when using `clang`).
The tool creates a `*.dot` file for each function in which one or more
disclosure gadgets was found. These files can be converted into image files:
```
$ ls *.dot | xargs dot -Tpng -O
```
For example, the following graph depicts a disclosure gadget where a function
argument influences the address of a zero-extended word load (`MOVZX`), whose
result then propagates to a cache covert channel transmitter (another `MOVZX`):

**Note**: The analysis in the
[blog post](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/news/update-to-research-on-disclosure-gadgets-in-linux.html)
was conducted on Linux v5.16.5, commit
8ab774587903771821b59471cc723bba6d893942, with the Makefile patch included in
this repository. For example:
```
$ cd linux
$ git checkout 8ab774587903771821b59471cc723bba6d893942
$ git apply <path-to-Branch-Target-Injection-Gadget-Finder>/linux-makefile-v5.16-5.patch
$ make clean
$ make LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 CC=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/clang defconfig
$ scripts/config -e LTO_CLANG_THIN
$ make LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 CC=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/clang \
    HOSTCC=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/clang \
    LD=<path-to-llvm>/build/bin/ld.lld
```
